# Composer-enabled Wordpress Upstream template
## Experimental

This is Pantheon's recommended starting point for forking new upstreams that work with the Platform's integrated
Composer build process. Replace this with a description of your site. See `upstream-config/README.md` for advice
on customizing this upstream and instructions on how to use it to create individual sites.

Because it is under active development, you should not create permanent/production sites using this repository
yet. We make no guarantees of backwards compatibility. Merging new updates from this repository may break existing
sites.
